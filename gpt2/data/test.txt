<BOS> This is a Rap song by LL Cool J: [Verse 1] When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove For the first time in my life, I see I need love There I was giggling about the games That I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names Then the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn As I said to myself, "look what you've done to her" I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal Playing make-believe pretending that I'm true Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you Saying amor kissing you on the ear Whispering, "I love you and I'll always be here" Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found A desire for true love floating around Inside my soul because my soul is cold One half of me deserves to be this way 'til I'm old But the other half needs affection and joy And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy  [Hook] I need love I need love [Verse 2] Romance, sheer delight, how sweet? I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat Kiss you on the cheek and say, "ooh girl, you're so sweet" It's deja vu whenever I'm with you I could go on forever telling you what I do But where you at? You're neither here or there I swear I can't find you anywhere Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug This love search is really making me bug And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen? Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean Fantasies can run, but they can't hide And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside  [Hook] I need love I need love  [Verse 3] I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you Grind, moan and never be alone If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad I've got money, but love's something I've never had I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all I love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I never been there Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet I swear to you this is something I'll never forget [Hook] I need love I need love  [Verse 4] See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration This whole experience has been such a revelation It's taught me love and how to be a real man To always be considerate and do all I can Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much My body tingles all over from the slightest touch Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine If I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive I'll search the whole world for that special girl When I finally find you watch our love unfurl  [Hook] I need love I need love [Outro] Girl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room all alone, staring at the wall Fantasies, they go through my mind, and I've come to realize that I need true love And if you wanna give it to me, girl, make yourself seen. I'll be waiting I love you1. <EOS>

That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' **** And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause‚Äî [Chorus] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left, we all fall down Like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win, but the battle wages on For toy soldiers  [Verse 2] There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it The shit gets escalated‚Äîit ain't just words no more, is it? It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin' We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin' Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record But now he's fucked the game up 'Cause one of the ways I came up Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'? Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then! But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc. And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind But we still have soldiers that's on the front line Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin' Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin' I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'Cause‚Äî [Chorus] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left, we all fall down Like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win, but the battle wages on For toy soldiers21. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Rock song by Bobby Goldsboro: See the tree, how big it's grown But friend it hasn't been too long It wasn't big I laughed at her and she got mad The first day that she planted it, was just a twig  Then the first snow came And she ran out to brush the snow away So it wouldn't die Came runnin' in all excited Slipped and almost hurt herself And I laughed till I cried She was always young at heart Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so And I surprised her with a puppy Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago  And it would sure embarrass her When I came in from workin' late Cause I would know That she'd been sittin' there and cryin' Over some sad and silly late, late show  And honey, I miss you And I'm bein' good And I'd love to be with you If only I could She wrecked the car and she was sad And so afraid that I'd be mad But what the heck Though I pretended hard to be Guess you could say she saw through me And hugged my neck  I came home unexpectedly And caught her cryin' needlessly In the middle of the day And it was in the early Spring When flowers bloom and robins sing She went away And honey, I miss you And I'm bein' good And I'd love to be with you If only I could  One day while I was not at home While she was there and all alone The angels came Now all I have is memories of Honey And I wake up nights and call her name  Now my life's an empty stage Where Honey lived and Honey played And love grew up And a small cloud passes overhead And cries down on the flower bed That Honey loved And see the tree how big it's grown But friend it hasn't been too long It wasn't big And I laughed at her and she got mad The first day that she planted it, was just a twig. <EOS>

She drinks and she talks quite a lot. She knows not to speak to my child and me." My neighbor then smiled and I thought  Oh, a tongue can accuse and carry bad news Gossip is cheap and it's lo-o-ow But unless you've made no mistakes in your life Be careful of stones that you throw  [Spoken]: Just then a car speeded by in the screamin' of brakes-a sound that made my blood chill For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path and saved by a girl lyin' still. The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out "Oh Who was that brave girl so sweet?" I covered the crushed broken body and said "The bad girl who lived down the street"  So unless you've made no mistakes in your life Just be careful of stones that you throw. <EOS>

Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah  [Verse 1: 2Pac] Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin' No fairy tales for this young black male Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales Hustlers hardly think of culture Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures Why shed tears? Save your sympathy My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me! Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now! [Hook: Johnny P & (2Pac)] Smile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now) Just smile, smile for me (Smile) (What you lookin' all sad for? Nigga, you black, smile for me now) Smile for me (Nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about) Won't you smile? (No doubt, smile for me now) Just smile (And the next generation)  [Verse 2: Scarface] Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote And I can walk you through the days that I done I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came? Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile! [Hook: Johnny P] Smile for me, won't you smile? Just smile, smile for me Smile for me Won't you smile? Just smile  [Verse 3: 2Pac] Fuck the world, as we unloading, witness furious speeds Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's Backstabbed and bleedin' Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin' Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' Inhale the sherm smoke, visualize the flames Will I be smothered by my own pain? Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us Hit us all, give us plenty centuries Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries The best revenge is "Fuck friends!" ‚Äì we military minded soldiers Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain Embrace my words, make the world change And still I smile, nigga [Bridge: Scarface] And now a moment of silence, let us pray And as you journey into outerspace May the angels help to lead the way May the prayers that our families made Shine up on your soul to keep you safe And all the homies that done passed away They there to greet you as you pass the gates And as you headed to the tunnel's light I hope it leads to eternal life We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac  [Hook: Johnny P] Smile, smile for me All you need to do is smile Woooo smile for me Come on, smile for me3. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Blues song by Ivory Joe Hunter: A bright array of city lights as far as I can see The Great White Way shines through the night for lonely guys like me The cabarets and honky tonks, their flashing signs invite A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights  Lights that say "Forget her name in a glass of sherry wine" Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights  The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night But God who put the stars above I don't believe He made those lights For it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights  Lights that say "Forget her love in a different atmosphere" Lights that lure are nothing but a masquerade for tears They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight And I just can't say "I love you" to a street of city lights. <EOS>

Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  And I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Weep not for the memories. <EOS>

M. U." (I Miss You) On Second Avenue. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Country song by Wade Hayes: I haven't had a good nights sleep in weeks .. thanks to you There goes to broken promises you made haunts every room A hurtin' heart can't get no rest around here I lie awake and wonder.. how your conscience can be clear  Chorus How do you sleep at night? Do you toss and turn to the morning light Does the darkness help when you lie down with the truth? How do you sleep at night? Are you all alone or holding someone tight? Do you see me when you close your eyes? How do you sleep at night?  Now your side of the beds as cold as the lies that I believed I'm at the point where I can't even trust you in my dreams Did the way you left me leave you feelin proud? Or does the loneliness come calling when the sun goes down?  Repeat chorus (x2). <EOS>

If there's a heaven, and a power's that's so higher Why babies die from gunshot wounds and house fires Sometimes I hit the weed and just meditate Could be ahead in life, if I ain't hesitate Nearly losing my life for fake street resumes Ashamed, probably why I smoke til I levitate Tryna forget memories that bring nothing but misery Suicidal thoughts, these flashbacks be killing me Make me drink the Hennessey and mastermind the end of me But I'll leave that in the hands of my enemies They say everyone is born with a purpose What happens when you're born feeling worthless And insecure, in another 24 without Jack Bauer Painful, would've been better off on a towel Apparently, I'm a disappointment to my parents My speculations caused me to stop caring My heart stopped beating on a November evening The day my grandma gave up and stopped breathing Right after my last visit, and the news was heavy on my heart Still a nigga had to get lifted I loss control so how you think you controlling me nigga You think you know but you don't know me like I know me nigga (Hook) The ups and downs, the highs and lows Wasted time wondering where it go Hiding my pain so the smiles will show You clueless for sho, you shouldn't speak on things you don't know I be singing the blues like (crooning) I be singing the blues like (crooning )  (Jeff Smith: 2nd Verse) I've been homeless, broke, suicidal and underpaid I was more of a loose cannon in my younger days Kept a lot of things hidden from my mama My life was like a movie, I was addicted to drama I pitched a little coke, I pitched a little weed Even participated in a few B&E's Being a follower lead me to bad places But lucky me, I avoided death and catching cases Another day to show my strength and my stamina Never thought I'd see the day that I'll become a janitor And I feel taken advantage of They won't promote a nigga to full time so fuck being manager I need benefits along with a bigger check And moms wonder why I still smoke cigarettes Sometimes I think I'm better dead off Intoxicated late nights contemplating blowing my head off Maybe I need a shrink, maybe I need a friend Maybe I need a piece of Heaven just to breathe again Cause mentally I was just in Hell And happiness ain't for sell, gotta find it through self I'm just a little nigga with a big heart Life us a big show and I'm just playing my part It took years for me to see the light standing in the dark Giving it up is easy but surviving is hella hard But what you know nigga (Hook) The ups and downs, the highs and lows Wasted time wondering where it go Hiding my pain so the smiles will show You clueless for sho, you shouldn't speak on things you don't know I be singing the blues like (crooning) I be singing the blues like (crooning)  (Bless Picasso: 3rd Verse) Yeah You get a glimpse when you look through IG But wasn't at the spital when I was hooked to IVs Yo, but I salute my lady and my Gs (One time) They showed love, that's the main ingredient But let's really get into it, needed blood transfusions So peace to those who kept me breathing Look I had to raise babies, had to make sure granny won't freezing So I pumped a little work and flipped my cash like a heathen Let's go back, I'm from where sewing Gators on your Polo Like B.I. was the number one 'No No' My friends had the military fours, I was rocking Reeboks -- the Classics But now I'm laughing while I'm cruising in a T-top But at the time I had a complex I seen the kids was fly but living in the projects Let's fast forward, sophomore year caught up in beef with hoe niggas Pig slammed me on a patrol car, go figure Dropped out, hit the Commonwealth challenge with some kids I knew Graduated early,  couldn't fail and be miserable Started getting serious with rap Moms paid for the first few joints, she had my back (That's love) Between time I had two seeds by two women Six months apart that shows you how I was living Look, I played my part for the better or the worse Only the tip of the iceberg I could fit up in a verse Word. <EOS>

And I see two boys Racin' up two flights of staircase Squirmin' into Papa's embrace And his whiskers warm on their face Where's it gone? Oh, where's it gone?  Two floors above the butcher First door on the right And life filled to the brim As I stood by my window And looked out on those Brooklyn Roads  I can still recall The smells of cookin' in the hallways Rubbers drying in the doorways And report cards I was always Afraid to show Mama'd come to school And as I sit there softly crying Teacher'd say, "He's just not trying Got a good head if he'd apply it But you know yourself It's always somewhere else."  I built me a castle With dragons and kings And I'd ride off with them As I stood by my window And looked out on those Brooklyn roads  Thought of going back But all I'd see are stranger's faces And all the scars that love erases But as my mind walks through those places I'm wonderin' What's come of them?  Does some other young boy Come home to my room Does he dream what I did As he stands by my window And looks out on those Brooklyn roads Brooklyn roads. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Country song by Glen Campbell: It's knowing that your door is always open And your path is free to walk That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag Rolled up and stashed behind your couch  And it's knowing I'm not shackled By forgotten words and bonds And the ink stains that are dried upon some line That keeps you in the backroads By the rivers of my memory That keeps you ever gentle on my mind  It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy Planted on their columns now that bind me Or something that somebody said Because they thought we fit together walking  It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find That you're moving on the backroads By the rivers of my memory And for hours you're just gentle on my mind Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines And the junkyards and the highways come between us And some other woman's cryin' to her mother Cause she turned and I was gone I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind  I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' Cracklin' caldron in some train yard My beard a-rustlin', coal pile And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  Through cupped hands 'round the tin can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find That you're waiting from the backroads By the rivers of my memories Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind. <EOS>

Beatty: Some people say this story is false But others say its true Fear not old ski king Because buddy I believe in you  The sun was a-shining The water it was smooth Ski King was in perfect form Daddy-o was in the groove  The pink Cadillac came a-sliding in With a big boat in the rear Ski king stepped out onto the sand and said The great ski king is here  Ski king fastened on his skis Fifty horses were getting warm The crowd let out a mighty roar Let's see that perfect form  He strutted to the waters edge He waved back to the crowd He pounded his chest like Tarzan would And that made daddy-o proud  Daddy-o backed up close to shore The rope was a perfect throw Ski king tied it around his arm and yelled Let it go daddy-o Daddy-o opened that throttle wide Sounded like a swarm of bees All of that power from the fifty horses made Ski king lose his skis  Poor ski king was a flying load Like a porpoise up and down They circled the lake about four or five times Daddy-o never looked around  Daddy-o was a-driving that boat Ski king was drinking the lake People were yelling at Daddy-o Stop the board for goodness sakes  Daddy-o finally stopped the boat He pulled ski king inside Poor ski king had plenty of water But he sure had lost his pride  Now the moral of this story Keep your neck out of a noose Be careful to grab ahold Of something you can't turn loose. <EOS>

Now, if they only can Time to let our children live in a land that's free. Ally, ally, ally, ally, oxen free  Time to blow the smoke away and look at the sky again.

Ally, ally, ally, ally, oxen free  Strong and weak, mild and meek, no more hide and seek Time to see the fairness of a children's game. Time for men to stop and learn to do the same Time to make our minds up if the world at last will be. Ally, ally, ally, ally, oxen free. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Rap song by Big Sean: [Produced by Amaire Johnson]  [Intro: Big Sean] They used to tell me, used to tell me  [Chorus: Big Sean] I hope you learn to make it on your own And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams And when you get it all, just remember one thing Remember one thing, that one man could change the world That one man could change the world  [Verse 1: Big Sean] All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots But it's hard makin' those attachments I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day You know? My - my stepbrother used to flip them bags Outside the crib like it was trash day No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye) But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it Tell your team about it, go make million-dollar schemes about it Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance Used to look up at the stars And be like, "Ain't too much that's different" I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission? [Chorus: Kanye West] And I hope you learn to make it on your own And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams And when you get it all, just remember one thing Remember one thing, one man could change the world One man could change the world  [Verse 2: Big Sean] My grandma told me, "If you write your name in stone You'll never get the white-out" I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks Where I'm from, I swear they broke They need way more than the cast We need more than what you have And then we need more than that But how am I supposed to say I'm tired If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions That I couldn't survive? Went to war, came back alive On top of that became a female black captain When being black, you had to extra-extra try Way before James Brown made us proud She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'... [Chorus: John Legend] I hope you learn to make it on your own And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams And when you get it all, just remember one thing Remember one thing, that one man can change the world That one man can change the world  [Outro: Grandma & Big Sean] Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about you It's all good, I love you grandma Bye31. <EOS>

There's a place I like to hide A doorway that I run through in the night Relax child, you were there But only didn't realize and you were scared It's a place where you will learn To face your fears, retrace the years And ride the whims of your mind Commanding in another world Suddenly you hear and see This magic new dimension  (I)... will be watching over you (I)... am gonna help you see it through (I)... will protect you in the night (I)... am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity [Instrumental]  [Spoken word] "Visualize your dream Record it in the present tense Put it into a permanent form If you persist in your efforts You can achieve dream control Dream control How's that then, better? Help me"  If you open your mind for me You won't rely on open eyes to see The walls you built within Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin Living twice at once you learn You're safe from pain in the dream domain A soul set free to fly A round trip journey in your head Master of illusion, can you realize Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...  (I)... will be watching over you (I)... am gonna help you see it through (I)... will protect you in the night (I)... am smiling next to you. <EOS>

Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say About a beautiful boy who died And it's about to be Halloween You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here I remember the last day, when I kissed your face And whispered in your ear [Chorus] "Come on, baby, with me We're going to fly away from here Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey We'll just disappear Come on, baby, with me We're going to fly away from here You were my best four years"  [Bridge] What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you? And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into? And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through? What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?  [Chorus] Come on, baby, with me We're going to fly away from here Come on, baby, with me We're going to fly away from here You were my best four years  [Outro] I remember you bare feet, down the hallway I love you to the moon and back1. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a R&B song by Chris Walker: Got a ride with my friends, still don't have a car Dropped off while they hit the mall Really caught my eyes from afar Looked away, no high's worth the fall I ain't tripping. Then I heard her talk. Sounded smart She on my radar like sonar Got me thinking what's a movie without a co-star? Just know that I'll only go so far Cuz sin dangerous, can't afford a close call So before I approached had caution Friend zone like a dead zone, Chris Walken Cuz guys want the end-zone early like the Falcons I only want the ring like there's 12 on my back I'm tryna win the game fair, that's my plan of attack We both got a past, but we can't take it back What's the point in fast if it don't last? Got questions but perhaps it's your name I should ask. Hey  (Chorus) I know that the feeling is right, and I don't ever want you to leave me Just know that we can't do it twice, it twice Your friends all give you advice, but do you believe me? Cuz I don't want it just for tonight. Tonight. Oh I  From a distance hard to read your intentions So I stayed away, found an exit in case This building set fire. She thinking, you're crazy Word to Mali, it gets hard little lady Wanna know your goals, do you got ambition? Say you wash dishes tryna pay off tuition Like to stay home, do you go to church? Nowadays everybody christian but their timeline isn't Friends don't connect if the wifi's missing Are you not afraid to speak but prefer to listen? Need the type of girl to enrich me Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me? Not that I'm getting paid Some want you making change; girl I'm tryna make a change. Can you relate? Would you see me different if you saw me on stage? If I dont ever make it would you look at me the same? Dang Girl just went and got her nails and her hair did Come closer, let me share what them nails did Got them thick curls Want a man that can give the whole world Can't guarentee yet, yeah I'll say it polite Nah I ain't tryna stay for the night Let me take it slow, get it right If you wanna be mine, then I'm digging for the diamonds in your mind AO (Chorus)  We still talking, can't help but feel amazing It's crazy what you find when you're not chasing Can't even lie my heart racing She hide her body, but her conversation enough to fascinate me As my mind on her eyes. A vibration rings loud My ride. Says it's time, bout to meet you outside I text back, did you really have to pull up right now? Apologize and say it's nice to meet her. She just smiles Figure I should ask if I could write her number down She frowned and said, sorry I don't really give that out Deflated. Stupid thinking she would take the time Turn to leave 'til she says, Wait, never mind Could she be the one? Only time will tell Is it God's will? Pray that I'm prepared Wish I could tell her how I feel, and how well the night went If we ever fall in love, give my life, thats a price well spent Forget a night, she the type to spend your life with Tell my homie and he say her reputation straight She nice and her faith strong. She don't ever fake Can't believe, stumbled on a girl with the right traits As the car drives further I can barely feel the brakes All of a sudden, somewhere my body seems to shake As I wake, reach my alarm, it's 8:15 Dawg I really can't believe it was a dream Girl of my dreams (Chorus). <EOS>

Get out of the way  I ain't got much time The young ones close behind I can't wait in line  If we can not wake you Then we'll have to shake you Though some say you'll only understand a gun Got to prove them wrong Or you will lose the battle Don't you know we'll start a war Which will be won by none Yesterday's glory won't help us today You wanna retire? Get out of the way  I ain't got much time The young ones close behind I can't wait in line  Move over Come on, Move Over  Repeat Chorus. <EOS>

Though you may not want me, my heart keeps repeating Onward, onward, time to stop retreating  Attack! Attack! Save the love we thought would live forever Attack! Attack! She wants me to run but I shall never For all is fair in love and war Your tender love I'll fight her for  Once I gave to you my love and sweet surrender But when you are in her arms you can't remember What am I to do? You say to me you love her But for me no other boy compares to you  All the dreams we shared, are they to end in sorrow? Shall I tell my heart there's no hope for tomorrow? Like a drum that's beating, my heart keeps repeating Onward, onward, time to stop retreating Attack! Attack! Save the love we thought would live forever Attack! Attack! She wants me to run but I shall never For all is fair in love and war Your tender love I'll fight her for  Night shall find me praying, God shall find me weeping 'Till your loving heart again is in my keeping No, she can not have you, not while my heart's beating Onward, onward, time to stop retreating  Attack!

<BOS> This is a Country song by Bobbie Gentry: I remember it all very well lookin' back It was the summer that I turned 18 We lived in a one-room, run down shack On the outskirts of New Orleans  We didn't have money for food or rent To say the least we were hard-pressed Then Momma spent every last penny we had To buy me a dancin' dress  Momma washed and combed and curled my hair And she painted my eyes and lips (Yeah) And then I stepped into my satin dancin' dress It was split on the side clean up to my hips  Well, it was red, velvet-trimmed And fit me good And starin' back from lookin' glass was a woman Where a half-grow'd kid had stood  "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do (Please) But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now, don't let me down Your momma's gonna help you move uptown" (Don't let me down, don't let me down) Momma dabbed a little bit of perfume On my neck and she kissed my cheek Then I saw the tears well up In her troubled eyes when she started to speak  She looked at our pitiful shack and then She looked at me and took a ragged breath "Your Pa's run off, and I'm real sick And the baby's gonna starve to death"  She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said "To thine own self be true" And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across The toe of my high-heeled shoe  It sounded like somebody else that was talkin' Askin', "Momma, what do I do?" "Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy And they'll be nice to you"  "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do (Please) But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now get on out, girl You better start movin' uptown" Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma The night I left that rickety shack 'Cause the welfare people came and took the baby Momma died and I ain't been back  But the wheels of fate had started to turn And for me there was no way out And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly What my momma been talkin' about  I did what I had to do But I made myself this solemn vow That I was gonna to be a lady someday Though I didn't know when or how  I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life With my head hung down in shame I mighta been born just plain "white trash" But Fancy was my name  "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"  It wasn't long after a benevolent man Took me in off the street And one week later I was pourin' his tea In a five-room hotel suite (Yes, she was) Well, I've charmed a king, a congressman And an occasional aristocrat And I got me a Georgia mansion And an elegant New York townhouse flat  And I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)  Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous Hypocrites that would call me "bad" And criticize my momma for turning me out No matter how little we had  And though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' For nigh on 15 years I can still hear the desperation In my poor momma's voice ringin' in my ear  "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down Lord, forgive me for what I do (Please) But if you want out, well, it's up to you Now don't let me down Your momma's gonna help you move uptown"  And I guess she did. <EOS>

Have you searched through all your dreams? Did you ever find a trace of me? Even though you say we're through That I'm not the one for you Have you looked into your heart?  When the evening shadows Fall upon my window pane I find I'm crying over and over And over and over again  Ever since we've been apart All I do is pray for your return Take a look and you will see Maybe there's a place for me Have you looked into your heart?  Ever since we've been apart All I do is pray for your return Take a look and you will see Maybe there's a place for me Have you looked into your heart?. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Rock song by Fuzz: The road back home was not as memorable as the road I had taken out of there‚Ä¶I am uncertain what I am even going back for‚Ä¶without realizing it, I have given up on the best part of me, and given in to the voice that enslaves‚Ä¶  To my welcome relief, my father greets me at the back door with a big smile and says ‚ÄúI knew you would be back‚Äù(which is his way of saying you shouldn‚Äôt have bothered leaving at all)‚Ä¶the car sits out in the alley while I drag what little junk I have (dirty clothes, one guitar, one amp, jewelry, my tapes and 4-track) up the back steps to the 3 small steps to my old room‚Ä¶the room is more like a cubbyhole (situated just off the kitchen, you can‚Äôt stand up fully but have to sort of crouch) that barely holds a standard size bed, which sits without frame (freshly made) on the floor‚Ä¶my appearance is shocking to my dad because when I had left, I had long, soft, curly brown hair, weighed about 187 pounds and was still essentially a withdrawn person (most would say shy)‚Ä¶now I looked like some sort of gothic gypsy come to rock you‚Ä¶at 167 pounds, with ratted black hair, shaved eyebrows, and a disposition that was outwardly nervous and un-nerving, I presented a decision that whoever was watching me would have to make‚Ä¶which side are you on?  As I will do repeatedly though my life, I have decided to turn my back on everything I have just stood for‚Ä¶I decide that I am going to give up on loud rock music, and instead focus more on songwriting‚Ä¶which in my funny-trick mind means giving away my fuzz and distortion pedals (which I do), sell my heavy metal records (all of which I will buy back later) and not even bother having a band‚Ä¶since the guitar is what I do best, it also figures that I will turn my back on my flashy, aggressive style and learn how to play ‚Äúreal‚Äù music‚Ä¶in my eyes, my greatest weaknesses are my songs and my voice, and it is here that I lay the blame for my lack of success (so far), the demise of my now deceased band, and how I have ended up back here‚Ä¶  Once settled back in, my dad informs me that since I am now an ‚Äúadult‚Äù (an incriminating and foreboding term in my family), I must help pay the rent‚Ä¶without negotiation he assigns me the going rate of $150 a month, which is half the rent that he pays on the house (he still covers utilities)‚Ä¶no mention is ever made of the $250 dollars (or my now long gone car) that he has ripped off from me, and since I am really in no position to get into it with him, I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶my paying rent, however, does not change the basic premise that it is his house, his rules, his insanity‚Ä¶my father‚Äôs home is located in a Polish-Italian neighborhood on Chicago‚Äôs northwest side, a former farm maintenance garage that has been crudely converted into a 2 bedroom shack‚Ä¶it is an absolute piece of shit, and is full of mice and roaches and car parts‚Ä¶the walls are battered, and bear the signs of a good-hearted attempt to ‚Äúfix it up‚Äù‚Ä¶initially, the home was to be ‚Äúhis studio‚Äù (he is a musician and mechanic)‚Ä¶ what was the front living room is now a sort of isolated control room, and a piece of studio glass separates this room and the middle room (the tracking room), which borders my dad‚Äôs bedroom, the back room off the alley‚Ä¶the kitchen has been wallpapered in beige sheet music, a constant reminder of what should be, and a profane joke‚Ä¶ like so many projects in his life, the house bears the signs and urgent energy of a good idea that never gets completed‚Ä¶but since the intention never gets fully put to rest, the dream lives on in a sort of unfinished state (wires hang out ceilings, fresh dry wall leans against an exposed wall, etc)‚Ä¶my father never uses the studio he has built anymore, which makes me sad‚Ä¶what is worse is I have never been allowed to use it to record my songs (no reason is ever given---I am only invited to once, when at 16, I play a hyper, scattered blues solo on one of my father‚Äôs songs)‚Ä¶we live right next door to his girlfriend, a former mistress turned eternal fianc√©‚Ä¶she lives in her family house that her mother had willed to her and her 2 sisters‚Ä¶my father had lived with her in the basement for years, but had moved to his house cause he just ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt take it anymore‚Äù‚Ä¶but my dad still lives there with her about half of the time‚Ä¶her home is open to me (generally speaking), but it is not quite an open door policy‚Ä¶(even though I have stayed there many times when I was younger)‚Ä¶I am family, but don‚Äôt have the rights of a son‚Ä¶ their relationship is fairly solid, but not particularly inclusive as she is not ‚Äúmy‚Äù mother, or even my step-mother, and my father seems to prefer keeping everyone in his life a bit separated (a common tactic among drug addicts)‚Ä¶at times, it feels like we are all vying for his attention: his children, his girlfriend, his friends, his ex-wives, his dog‚Ä¶when he is not out hustling, my dad spends his days mostly working out of the garage, which infuriates the neighbors because he makes a lot of noise doing bodywork and tune-ups‚Ä¶he takes it all in stride, because my father has a rock and roll persona in whatever he does, the body language a constant ‚Äúwhatever, I don‚Äôt give a fuck‚Äù‚Ä¶  It is floating here, in my dad‚Äôs world, lost between childhood and being a true adult, that I come to some critical conclusions‚Ä¶it seems to me if I am indeed ever going to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù as an artist, I am going to have to get really serious‚Ä¶and though it be damned, I am going to have figure out a way to get some money‚Ä¶I start taking odd jobs around the neighborhood, mowing lawns and painting porches‚Ä¶I even try to help my dad in the garage some, but I hate it, and he looks down on me and tells me he cannot believe how lazy a son I am‚Ä¶I work at a college bookstore, which needs extra help selling books when school comes into session‚Ä¶as someone who was an honor student all his life, this is humiliating to me to be on the other side of the counter, knowing full well that by turning down scholarships and grants for college I have walked away from what could have been a very erudite and secure life (I was even recruited by the University of Michigan for political science!)‚Ä¶I had wanted to be a history major, or quite possibly a psychologist, but all that seemed pretty far away, standing there as I was, looking like an outcast from the Munsters handing out chemistry books to 18 year olds‚Ä¶the old man who ran the book store had owned it for something like 40 years‚Ä¶at first he eyed me with a deep suspicion, wondering if someone hadn‚Äôt made a mistake in hiring me‚Ä¶he had recently had a stroke, and walked slowly with a bit of a limp, eyes raised just above his glasses‚Ä¶he thankfully kept me on, and ultimately praised me for being such a good worker and person‚Ä¶we had absolutely nothing in common, so when things were slow, we would try to find some common subject, like talking about the weather, or some news item in the paper‚Ä¶yet as small as it sounds, I really appreciate this man for not judging me, and welcoming me into his small world‚Ä¶it is a small but needed boost of confidence, and really helps things at home as I am able to pay my share of the rent‚Ä¶  This period is one of the few times in my life when things get really, really quiet‚Ä¶there is an easy hold on everything I do, because I am not really sure what to do‚Ä¶I spend a lot of time in my room, listening to scratched records I find in thrift stores, making demos I know no one will hear‚Ä¶I take music on from an entirely different point of view, trying to understand how great songwriters come to their decisions‚Ä¶why they choose one chord over another?‚Ä¶patterns begin to emerge, and I start to see songwriting as a type of architecture‚Ä¶I look for the hidden meanings in lyrics, and start to understand that my favourite lyricists speak in a kind of code‚Ä¶I dismantle kick and snare drum sounds, watching from the sidelines how the drummers and bass players perform a secret dance underneath the music‚Ä¶the beauty of music opens up to me as a sound that I can see, and I learn slowly I can write the program anyway I choose‚Ä¶there are so many bits and pieces, so many decisions, each direction creating a whole new set of possibilities and problems‚Ä¶and like someone who is learning to walk anew, I stumble around for a bit, digging at the most basic of feelings until I find the inklings of my own language‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt trust my own intuitions, and fight them at every turn‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt want to sound like me, but every attempt to sing like anyone else miserably fails‚Ä¶I won‚Äôt allow myself to play guitar my ‚Äúold‚Äô way (which is really, really loud!), so I must create the violence that I seek in key changes instead of raw power‚Ä¶I feel incredibly humbled, because it just won‚Äôt happen (or sound) the way I want it to‚Ä¶and so it comes that buried below all these ideas that I am recording that are reminiscent of the Cure, or the Sisters of Mercy, or Pink Floyd, or whatever, is hiding ME‚Ä¶. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a Rock song by Janis Ian: Spanish boys'll greet you With that old obscene refrain The sadness of a thousand Waiting window panes Gypsy boys'll beat you At your own familiar game While the whore on the corner Drags that same old ball and chain  They make better lovers Or so I've been told Under the covers That's where you discover If your man is whole They don't come easy But they're worth the time And if you please me Maybe I'll let you be mine  Latin boys are easy They'll touch you with their eyes Handle you the way they need Without disguise Gypsy boys'll fool you Into global compromise While occasional candy Keeps your belly satisfied [Chorus:] They say they only hurt you Because they're hurting themselves And they don't mean to Dry up all your wishing wells They say you should be truthful But you know sometimes they lie And though it isn't meant to It still tears me up inside  [Chorus:]. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Rock song by Rupert Holmes: [Verse 1] I was tired of my lady We'd been together too long Like a worn out recording Of a favorite song So while she lay there sleeping I read the paper in bed And in the personal columns There was this letter I read:  [Hook] "If you like pi√±a coladas And getting caught in the rain If you're not into yoga If you have half a brain If you like making love at midnight In the dunes on the cape Then I'm the love that you've looked for Write to me and escape"  [Verse 2] I didn't think about my lady I know that sounds kind of mean But me and my old lady Had fallen into the same old dull routine So I wrote to the paper Took out a personal ad And though I'm nobody's poet I thought it wasn't half bad: [Hook] "Yes, I like pi√±a coladas And getting caught in the rain I'm not much into health food I am into champagne I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon And cut through all this red tape At a bar called O'Malley's Where we'll plan our escape"  [Verse 3] So I waited with high hopes And she walked in the place I knew her smile in an instant I knew the curve of her face It was my own lovely lady And she said, "Aw, it's you" Then we laughed for a moment And I said, "I never knew..."  [Hook] "...That you like pi√±a coladas And gettin' caught in the rain And the feel of the ocean And the taste of champagne If you like making love at midnight In the dunes on the cape You're the lady I've looked for Come with me and escape" [Hook] If you like pi√±a coladas And getting caught in the rain If you're not into yoga If you have half a brain If you like making love at midnight In the dunes on the cape Then I'm the love that you've looked for Write to me and escape  [Hook] Yes I like pi√±a coladas And getting caught in the rain I'm not much into health food I am into champagne I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon And cut through all this red tape At a bar called O'Malley's Where we'll plan our escape4. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Electronica song by Brat Pack: [Eminem] "Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings." "But I'm only going to get this one chance." "Something's wrong, I can feel it." Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on! "Just a feeling I've got. Like something is about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances." "You are just what the doc ordered."  [Tyler] I wake up fine and dandy But then by the time I find it handy To rip my heart apart and start Planning my crash landing I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling Then I feel my soul start leaving Like an old man's hair receding I'm pleading, "Please, oh please!" On my knees repeatedly asking Why it's got to be like this Is this living free? I don't wanna be the one Be the one to have the sun's blood on my hands I'll tell the moon Take this weapon, forged in darkness Some see a pen, I see harpoon [Eminem] This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match With this rappity-brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac' Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots, and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad It's actually disastrously bad for the wack While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece  I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard  [Tyler] There‚Äôs an infestation in my mind‚Äôs imagination I hope that they choke on smoke cause I‚Äôm smoking them out the basement This is not rap, this is not hip-hop Just another attempt to make the voices stop Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something Cause I wasn‚Äôt the only one who wasn‚Äôt rushing to saying nothing This doesn‚Äôt mean I lost my dream It‚Äôs just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean Nah, I didn‚Äôt understand a thing you said If I didn‚Äôt know better, I'd guess you‚Äôre all already dead Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch Saying stuff like, ‚Äúyou only live once" You've got one time to figure it out One time to twist and one time to shout One time to think and I say we start now Sing it with me if you know what I‚Äôm talking about  [Eminem] Hall of Fame Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of (shame) You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'? Little gay-looking boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy You're witnessing a massacre Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy "Oy vey, that boy's gay!", that's all they say, looking boy You get a thumbs up, pat on the back And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy Hey, looking boy! What you say, looking boy? I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit Get outta my face, looking boy! Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause‚Äî I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planet's Krypton ‚Äì no, Asgard, Asgard  [Tyler] On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate The start of a day when we put on our face A mask that portrays that we don't need grace On the eve of a day that is bigger than us But we open our eyes, cause we're told that we must And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead Desperately yelling, "There's something we need!" I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime I'm afraid to tell you who I adore Won't tell you who I'm singing towards Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four  [Eminem] Once in a while So I wanna make sure, somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin' To censor you, like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9  [Tyler] "I'd die for you," that's easy to say We have a list of people that we would take A bullet for them, a bullet for you A bullet for everybody in this room But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through See many bullets coming through Metaphorically I'm the man But literally I don't know what I'd do "I'd live for you," and that's hard to do Even harder to say when you know it's not true Even harder to write when you know that tonight There were people back home who tried talking to you But then you ignore them still All these questions they‚Äôre for real Like who would you live for? Who would you die for? And would you ever kill?  [Eminem] I'ma kill you! Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad) Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music "Oh, he's too mainstream." Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it "It's not hip-hop, it's pop," because I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it  [Tyler] I'm evil to the core What I shouldn't do I will They say I'm emotional What I want to save I'll kill Is that who I truly am? I truly don't have a chance Tomorrow I'll keep a beat And repeat yesterday's dance  Yo, this song will never be on the radio Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote It's the few, the proud, and the emotional Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral The world around us is burning but we're so cold It's the few, the proud, and the emotional  We've turned our hands to guns Traded our thumbs for ammunition I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition Cause when the sun sets It upsets what's left of my invested interest Interested in putting my fingers to my head The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids Fused at the wrist I simply tell them they should shoot at this Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist  [Eminem] Make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard; be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Rock song by Mark Lindsay: There was a hill we climbed And a verse we rhymed Went flying across the waving grass Like, like silver bells Against the curtain that the sky had made Ooh, and so we played  It was a sunny day, and so we lay Beneath the rock that sheltered us From passing planes And the earth caught fire when you turned But nothing burned  There were nights when the lights Would take us nowhere For just a little while cars would pass And we were out of gas But we didn't care even though we walked a mile  There was a deejay in L.A We used to tune in at night To hear our favorite song We always heard it at that perfect time Up on that hill we climbed  And now you're gone and I'm alone And though they say I should be Safe, secure, and sane Oh, I still remember yesterday And the games that children play. <EOS>

Now don't be wishin' of switchin' any positions with me Cause when you in my position, it ain't never easy To do any type of maintainin' Cause all this gamin' and famin' from entertainin' Is hella strainin' (to the brain and) But I can't keep runnin' I just gotta keep keen and cunnin'  [Hook] Can't keep running away Can't keep running away Can't keep running away Can't keep running away  [Produced by J Dilla]3. <EOS>

ain't catching your eye Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer You're turning me on, keep me standing up I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough I come up to your job and handcuff your boss Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off Then sit you up on the copy machine Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see Baby I'm down on my knees let your world be free Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me Multiple orgasms is your destiny Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18 To hell with your boss Let that nigga hear you scream Sounding like that screech on the fax machine Then

white socks The vibe is thick baby, we both red hot I kiss your neck unbutton your blouse Let my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth Your apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life Got your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight You could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey But no Trojan soldier scold you like me Match the calculus then measure my frequency But when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree Put your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails Give me goose pimples when ya put yo tounge on my dimples Baby feel me now you got yo ass suspended Got a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it I stopped by the crib you invited me in You convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin Then you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back You twisting, kissing ya fist like that Rubber meets the road till the tire goes flat I filled it up with air again baby hold that You a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet Squeeze tight so i never forget the teacher's pet [Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool J)] I'ma get you for your paper Make you leave you girl (Imagine that) Make you trick on me around the world (Imagine that) Have you calling me your

you and wrapped you with my mink Guided you to the dance floor and held you tight We in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights I'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice You rocking the

it cause you know that I want it God gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it Life is a song, you were born to perform it Drink the Cristal at the same time Get intoxicated till we lose are minds The crowd seperated as we start to shine I lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb We tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd The lights start to flash the music is too loud We hit the back door and jump in the limousine You pull up your skirt I put some ice in between You're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet Even though we outside I hear the bass from the beat Funkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks DJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep No problem uh mi spouse no aqui Tu muy caliente tu vamos con mi Si mami I'm the chaffer make it whip Take a ride bet you never forget,

'Cause I'm lit‚Äînarrow minded But go through such a wide range of this emotion That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways I just pulled up in Clive Davis's driveway With his personal memoir, saying "He's bi!" Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride Making him cry, "Rape!"‚Äîthen arrive naked And drive straight through the gay pride parade "Yay!

I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew Clear blue and unconditional skies Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein? What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain You claim the insane, and name this day in time For falling prey to crime I say the system's got you victim to your own mind Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you [Chorus: TLC (Chilli)] Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're moving too fast Don't go chasing waterfalls Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast) Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go) Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (I know, I know, your way hey) But I think you're moving too fast4. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Rock song by Don McLean: I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle You just slow down Round and around the world you go Spinning through the lives of the people you know We all slow down  How you gonna keep on turnin' from day to day? How you gonna keep from turnin' your life away? No days you can borrow, no time you can buy No trust in tomorrow, it's a lie  I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle You just slow down Round and around the world you go Spinning through the lives of the people you know We all slow down  How you gonna keep on turnin' from day to day? How you gonna keep from turnin' your life away?  And I feel like I'm dippin' and divin' My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels I'm lost in this star car I'm drivin' But my air sole keeps pushin' big wheels My world is a constant confusion My mind is prepared to attack My past, a persuasive illusion I'm watchin' the future it's black  What do you know? You know just what you perceive What can you show? Nothing of what you believe And as you grow, each thread of life that you leave Will spin around your deeds and dictate your needs As you sell your soul and you sow your seeds And you wound yourself and your loved one bleeds And your habits grow, and your conscience feeds On all that you thought you should be I never thought this could happen to me  I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel The spinnin' don't stop when you leave the cradle You just slow down Round and around this world you go Spinnin' through the lives of the people you know We all slow down  How you gonna keep on turning from day to day? How you gonna keep from turning your life away?  I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle You just slow down. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Rock song by Harry Chapin: [Verse 1] I come fresh from the street, fast on my feet Kinda lean and lazy Not much meat on my bones and a whole lot alone And more than a little bit crazy  The old six string was all I had, to keep my belly still And for each full hour lesson I gave I got a crisp ten dollar bill  You see, she was married for seven years To a concrete castle king She said she wanted to learn to play the guitar And to hear her children sing So I'd show up about once a week in my faded tight legged jeans With a backlog full of hobo stories and dilapidated dreams  [Chorus] She said "I wanna learn a love song Full of happy things" She said "I wanna learn a love song Won't you let me hear you sing?" She said "I wanna learn a love song I wanna hear you play" She said "I wanna learn a love song Before you go away" [Verse 2] So I tried to teach her a couple of chords and an easy melody But it always turned out she'd rather listen to my guitar and me I could hear her old man laughing in the den Playing stud poker with the boys While I sang so soft in the living room, too scared to make much noise  I came one week, the den was dark and she met me at the door And we sat on the couch and we sang and talked till I could not sing no more You know the silence kept in building Her eyes grew much too wide And I could hear both of our heart beats, but there was no place to hide  [Chorus] She said "I wanna learn a love song Full of happy things" She said "I wanna learn a love song Won't you let me hear you sing?" She said "I wanna learn a love song I wanna hear you play" She said "I wanna learn a love song Before you go away"  [Verse 3] Well, I guess you know what happened God I, I never been so clean Yes, I feel like i'm working in a Hollywood movie Or living out a good bad dream And all them pin up girls in that tinsel world Never touched me like she can It took another man's wife in the real world life to make this boy a man [Chorus] She said "I wanna learn a love song Full of happy things" She said "I wanna learn a love song Won't you let me hear you sing?" She said "I wanna learn a love song I wanna hear you play" She said "I wanna learn a love song Before you go away"  I guess you know i stayed. <EOS>

He said "Listen smart ass You don't fit his description" I said "Hey, I could be strapped for all you know" He said "Hey, you want me to start friskin'?" I said "Not really" And he said "Listen man, I'm serious You better be on your way" I said "But your cop car looks so cozy And I'm enjoying this conversation"  Anyhow, it's nice to be here here here in Phoenix Even though the cops are complete fucking dicks Anyhow it's nice to be here here here here here here in Phoenix I hope you like this next song You might recognize it It's my biggest hit  (Shut the fuck up and listen to him!)

<BOS> This is a Rap song by Macklemore: [Piano Intro] [Verse 1: Macklemore] When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay ‚ÄòCause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight I told my mom, tears rushing down my face She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!" Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she? A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math like, "Yeah, I'm good at little league." A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant For those that like the same sex had the characteristics The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition Playing God, aw nah, here we go America the brave still fears what we don't know And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago I don't know [Chorus: Mary Lambert] And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm [Verse 2: Macklemore] If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me Have you read the YouTube comments lately? "Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily We've become so numb to what we're sayin' Our culture founded from oppression Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it "Gay" is synonymous with the lesser It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference Live on and be yourself When I was at church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same, but that's not important No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it [Trombone Interlude] [Chorus: Mary Lambert] And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm [Verse 3: Macklemore] We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on! With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause 'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law Kids are walking 'round the hallway Plagued by a pain in their heart A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all But it's a damn good place to start No law's gonna change us, we have to change us Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love About time that we raised up! [Chorus: Mary Lambert] And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm [Outro: Mary Lambert] Love is patient Love is kind Love is patient Love is kind (not crying on Sundays) Love is patient (not crying on Sundays) Love is kind (not crying on Sundays) Love is patient (not crying on Sundays) Love is kind (not crying on Sundays) Love is patient (not crying on Sundays) Love is kind (not crying on Sundays) Love is patient Love is kind23. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Rock song by Alan Parsons Project: If you believe in the power magic I can change your mind And if you need to believe in someone Turn and look behind When we were living in a dream world Clouds got in the way We gave it up in a moment of madness And threw it all away Don't answer me, don't break the silence Don't let me win Don't answer me, stay on your island Don't let me in Run away and hide from everyone Can you change the things we've said and done? If you believe in the power of magic It's all a fantasy So if you need to believe in someone Just pretend it's me It ain't enough that we meet as strangers I can't set you free So will you turn your back forever on what you mean to me?  Don't answer me, don't break the silence Don't let me win Don't answer me, stay on your island Don't let me in Run away and hide from everyone Can you change the things we've said and done?. <EOS>

Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't? Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music "Oh, he's too mainstream." Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it "It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"‚Äî'cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it "I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use." Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?! Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel I'ma sleep in the front seat Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have, then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?! Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard‚Äîbe a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?6.7K. <EOS>

Smith: See the tree How big it's grown But friend it hasn't been too long, wasn't it I laughed at her And she got made The first day she planted it Was just a twig And then the first snow came And she ran out to brush the snow away So it wouldn't die Came running in all excited Slipped and almost hurt herself And I laughed till I cried She was always young at heart And kind of dumb, kind of smart And I loved her so I surprised her with a puppy Kept me up all Christmas eve, two years ago And it would sure embarrass her When I came home from workin' late Cause I would know That she'd been sitting there and crying Over some sad and silly late late show And honey I miss you Oh and I'm being good And I'd love to be with you If only I could Oh she wrecked the car And she was sad And so afraid I'd be mad But what the heck Though I pretended hard to be Guess you could say she saw through me And hugged my neck I came home unexpectedly And found her crying needlessly In the middle of the day And it was in the early spring When flowers bloom and robins sing She went away One day while I wasn't home While she was there and all alone The angels came Now all I have is memories of honey And I wake up nights and call her name Now my life's an empty stage Where honey lived and honey played And love grew up A small cloud passes overhead And cries down in the flowerbed That honey loved Oh honey I miss you Miss you And I'm being good And I'd love to be with you Honey I miss you Miss you I'm being good And I'd love to be with you If only I could. <EOS>

<BOS> This is a Rock song by Elvis Presley: [Verse 1] Where do you come from? Tell me who you are Do you come from another world Or from some distant star?  [Verse 2] Where do you come from? Are you what you seem? Are you real? Are you standing there? Or is it just a dream?  [Verse 3] Tell me more about yourself Do you feel the way I feel? Are you just a vision Or are you really real?  [Verse 4] Where do you come from? Angel won't you say? Tell me all that there is to know And tell me that you'll stay. <EOS>
<BOS> This is a Country song by Freddy Fender: [Verse 1] If he brings you happiness Then I wish you all the best It's your happiness that matters most of all But if he ever breaks your heart If the teardrops ever start I'll be there before the next teardrop falls  [Verse 2] Si te quiere de verdad Y te da felicidad Te deseo lo mas bueno pa'los dos Pero si te hace llorar A mi me puedes hablar Y estare contigo cuando triste estas  [Verse 3] I'll be there anytime You need me by your side To drive away every teardrop that you cried And if he ever leaves you blue Just remember, I love you And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls And I'll be there before the next teardrop falls. <EOS>
