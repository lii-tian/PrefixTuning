<BOS> This is a Country song by Chad Brock: You know nothin's gettin' done When talk is all you hear Like someone revvin' up a truck They never put in gear But you don't see a cowboy run his mouth And strut around He just takes the bull by the horns And throws him to the ground Takin' care of business not just puttin' on a show When it gets down to it, everybody knows  It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  You can talk about the farm or you can plow the ground Argue with a rusty nail or hammer it on down You can stand there in the dark cussin' at the night Or you can just reach out your hand and turn on the light There ain't no limit in this life to how far you can get But if you're goin' all the way you gotta break a sweat  It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work I've heard thunder talkin' up a storm Rattlin' my windows and knockin' on my door But I've seen lightnin' blow a cypress tree in half The thunder's busy talkin', and lightnin's kickin'  --- Instrumental ---  It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work  It's gonna getcha, getcha good.... <EOS>
